# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the VSX Remote SSH extension by adding the ability to mount remote folders as if they were local, providing a seamless experience for developers working with remote codebases. This functionality will allow users to browse, edit, and interact with remote files through the standard VS Code file explorer, without having to explicitly use SSH commands or remote paths.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to mount remote folders as if they were local in VS Code, so that I can work with remote files seamlessly through the standard file explorer.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user connects to a remote host via SSH THEN the system SHALL provide an option to mount a remote folder
2. WHEN a user selects a remote folder to mount THEN the system SHALL display the remote folder in the VS Code explorer as if it were a local folder
3. WHEN a user navigates the mounted folder in the explorer THEN the system SHALL display remote files and directories with appropriate icons and metadata
4. WHEN a user expands directories in the mounted folder THEN the system SHALL load and display the remote directory contents
5. IF the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL indicate that the mounted folder is disconnected and attempt to reconnect

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform standard file operations on mounted remote folders, so that I can work with remote files using the same workflows I use for local files.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user creates a new file in a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL create the file on the remote server
2. WHEN a user edits and saves a file in a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL save the changes to the remote server
3. WHEN a user deletes a file in a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL delete the file from the remote server
4. WHEN a user renames a file in a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL rename the file on the remote server
5. WHEN a user drags and drops files in a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL perform the corresponding operations on the remote server

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage multiple mounted remote folders, so that I can work with different remote locations simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user has multiple SSH connections THEN the system SHALL allow mounting folders from each connection
2. WHEN a user wants to mount multiple folders from the same connection THEN the system SHALL support multiple mount points
3. WHEN a user no longer needs a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL provide a way to unmount it
4. WHEN VS Code is restarted THEN the system SHALL restore previously mounted folders
5. WHEN switching between mounted folders THEN the system SHALL maintain the correct context for each folder

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mounted remote folders to integrate with VS Code features, so that I can use extensions, search, and other tools with remote files.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user searches within a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL perform the search on the remote files
2. WHEN a user uses the VS Code find/replace functionality THEN the system SHALL apply it to remote files
3. WHEN a user opens a terminal in a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL open a remote terminal in that location
4. WHEN VS Code extensions interact with files in a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL handle the operations correctly on remote files
5. WHEN a user uses source control features THEN the system SHALL correctly interact with remote repositories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient performance when working with mounted remote folders, so that my workflow is not hindered by network latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user browses a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL use caching to improve navigation performance
2. WHEN a user opens a file in a mounted folder THEN the system SHALL load it efficiently with appropriate buffering
3. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully and provide feedback on connection status
4. WHEN large files are accessed THEN the system SHALL use streaming and partial loading to maintain responsiveness
5. WHEN many files are being monitored THEN the system SHALL optimize file watching to minimize network traffic
