# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Visual Studio Code extension (VSX) that enables developers to connect to and work with remote servers via SSH. The extension will allow users to edit files, run commands, and develop applications on remote machines as if they were working locally, providing a seamless remote development experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect to a remote server via SSH, so that I can develop and edit code on remote machines directly from VS Code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the command palette and selects "Connect to Host via SSH" THEN the system SHALL prompt for SSH connection details
2. WHEN a user provides valid SSH credentials (hostname, username, port) THEN the system SHALL establish an SSH connection
3. WHEN an SSH connection is established THEN the system SHALL open a new VS Code window connected to the remote host
4. IF SSH key authentication is available THEN the system SHALL use key-based authentication over password authentication
5. WHEN connection fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to browse and edit files on the remote server, so that I can work with remote codebases seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to a remote host THEN the system SHALL display the remote file system in the Explorer panel
2. WHEN a user opens a remote file THEN the system SHALL load and display the file content in the editor
3. WHEN a user saves changes to a remote file THEN the system SHALL persist changes to the remote file system
4. WHEN a user creates, deletes, or renames files/folders THEN the system SHALL perform these operations on the remote file system
5. WHEN file operations fail due to permissions THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run terminal commands on the remote server, so that I can execute build scripts, run applications, and perform system administration tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to a remote host THEN the system SHALL provide access to a remote terminal
2. WHEN a user opens a terminal THEN the system SHALL establish a shell session on the remote host
3. WHEN a user executes commands in the terminal THEN the system SHALL run commands on the remote server and display output
4. WHEN multiple terminal sessions are needed THEN the system SHALL support multiple concurrent remote terminal sessions
5. WHEN the SSH connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect terminal sessions automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage multiple SSH connections, so that I can work with different remote servers efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has multiple SSH hosts configured THEN the system SHALL display a list of available connections
2. WHEN a user selects a configured host THEN the system SHALL connect using saved connection details
3. WHEN a user wants to save connection details THEN the system SHALL store SSH host configurations securely
4. WHEN a user wants to edit connection details THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to modify saved configurations
5. WHEN switching between remote hosts THEN the system SHALL maintain separate workspace contexts for each connection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want VS Code extensions to work on remote files, so that I can use my full development toolchain on remote code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to a remote host THEN the system SHALL support running compatible extensions on remote files
2. WHEN language servers are needed THEN the system SHALL install and run language servers on the remote host
3. WHEN debugging remote applications THEN the system SHALL support remote debugging capabilities
4. WHEN extensions require local resources THEN the system SHALL handle extension compatibility gracefully
5. WHEN extension installation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a way to install extensions on the remote host

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure and reliable SSH connections, so that my remote development work is protected and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing SSH connections THEN the system SHALL use secure SSH protocols (SSH-2)
2. WHEN storing SSH credentials THEN the system SHALL use secure credential storage mechanisms
3. WHEN SSH connections are interrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection
4. WHEN reconnection fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide manual reconnection options
5. WHEN closing VS Code THEN the system SHALL properly terminate SSH connections and clean up resources
