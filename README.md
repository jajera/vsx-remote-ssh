## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- **"Connection refused"**: Check SSH server is running
- **"Authentication failed"**: Verify credentials
- **"Host key verification failed"**: Accept host key manually first
- **"Connection timeout"**: Check network and firewall settings
- **"ERR_REQUIRE_ESM" or module compatibility errors**: The extension uses CommonJS modules. If you encounter module system compatibility errors, ensure your VS Code version is compatible and the extension is properly installed.

### Performance Issues

- **Slow file operations**: Check network latency
- **High memory usage**: Reduce cache size in settings
- **Connection drops**: Enable auto-reconnection

### File System Issues

- **"Permission denied"**: Check file permissions on server
- **"File not found"**: Verify remote path exists
- **"Disk space"**: Check available disk space on server
